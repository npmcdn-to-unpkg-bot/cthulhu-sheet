# cthulhu-sheet
Interactive character sheet for Call of Cthulhu 7edition pen and paper RPG (Made with React.js)

##Wouldn't it be cool to have your character sheet on a tablet?

Sure it would! That would make so much sense, you could:
* Let the tablet take care of half-values and fifth-values
* Get all your derived characteristics sorted out automagically
* Make character generation a breeze (CoC characters tend to die)
* Get instant access to skill values by sorting and filtering
* Expand skills to get big, easy-on-the-eyes values, skill descriptions
* And save all your characters to the _cloud_... which I guess would be called _the umbra_ or something in cthulhuesque 

## Work in progress
Enjoy this for what it is: a work in progress so far, and a learning experience... feel free to chip in with a fork if you feel like it.

## Usage
~~If you just want to use this, there's no installation - just go to this here adress with your browser and it should work straight in the browser:

Actually, as central functionality (see Issues) is missing, so it's not ready for the public. So there's nothing on the link above right now, check back soon!

If you still want to check it out, clone this repository and open you local version of index.html in your web browser... that is actually pretty much it. But please make sure that you're using a fairly recent browser.
